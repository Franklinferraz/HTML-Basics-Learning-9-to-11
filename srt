Mid-lesson breather

You've done an awesome job! Here's a quick summary of things we've learned:

HTML is used to give websites structure.
We open HTML files using a browser, and the browser renders (shows us) the file.
HTML files have a <head> and a <body> (just like you!)
In the head, we have the <title> tags, and we use these to specify the webpage's name.
How to make headings and paragraphs.

Instructions

Add a title between the <title> tags.
Create a <h3> sized heading in the body. 
Make your heading say anything you want! (Just don't forget to close it.)
Create three paragraphs using <p> tags and fill them with content 
(e.g. about cars, your pet, favorite city to travel—whatever you like!)

10. You're going places!

What if you wanted to send the user to another part of your website, or another website altogether? You use hyperlinks, or links for short!

<a href="http://www.codecademy.com">My Favorite Site!</a>

First, there's an opening <a> tag and that tag has an attribute called href. 
The href value tells your link where you want it to go, in this case http://www.codecademy.com.
Then you have a description of your link between your opening <a> and your closing </a> tags.
This is what you will be able to click on.
Finally, you have your closing </a> tag.

Instructions

In the body section, create a link. To do this, create an <a> tag. Point your link to a website by setting the value of the href attribute
Add a description of your link
Close the element with a closing tag </a>

11.Adding images

You can add images to your websites to make them look fancy.

We use an image tag, like so: <img>. This tag is a bit different from the others. 
Instead of putting the content between the tags, you tell the tag where to get the picture using src. 
It's also different because there is no ending tag. It has / in the tag to close it: <img src="url" />.

Check out the tag to the right—it adds a picture of a rubber duck to the page! 
(You can see it by clicking on the Preview button.)

See the web address (or URL) after src=? It's "http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/f3a16fb6.jpg". 
That tells the <img> tag where to get the picture from!

Every image on the web has its own image URL. 
Simply right-click on an image and choose "Copy image URL." Paste that URL in quotes after src= to insert with your <img> tag.

Instructions
Add a second image below the first one. (Make sure it's before the closing <body> tag!)
